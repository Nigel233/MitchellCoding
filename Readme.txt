I implemented an web interface that can create, update, get and delete Vehicle data points based on Java (JSP Servelet) and MySQL database.

Prequisites: 

Eclipse SDE (Apache Tomcat 9.0)
Java 13
MySQL (locally running)

To run this code, open it in Eclipse, start apache server, and run it in debug mode. You can perform the operations on web interfaces.
